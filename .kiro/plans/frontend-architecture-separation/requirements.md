# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on determining the optimal architecture for separating or integrating the different frontend interfaces of the RSS application. Currently, the system has two main components: an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that provides RSS feed functionality through a command-line interface, and a web-based Amplify application that offers similar functionality through a graphical user interface. This feature will establish clear requirements for how these components should be structured, maintained, and developed to ensure consistency, reduce duplication, and improve maintainability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clear architectural separation between the MCP server and web frontend components, so that I can maintain and evolve each independently without affecting the other.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN changes are made to the MCP server implementation THEN the web frontend SHALL NOT require modifications unless the API contract changes
2. WHEN changes are made to the web frontend THEN the MCP server SHALL NOT require modifications
3. IF a new feature is added to either component THEN the architecture SHALL provide clear guidance on where and how to implement it

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to share common data models and business logic between the MCP server and web frontend, so that I can avoid code duplication and ensure consistency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data models are defined THEN they SHALL be accessible to both the MCP server and web frontend
2. WHEN business logic is implemented THEN it SHALL be reusable across both components where appropriate
3. IF a data model is updated THEN the change SHALL propagate to both components

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a product manager, I want feature parity between the MCP server and web frontend, so that users have a consistent experience regardless of which interface they choose.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a feature is available in the MCP server THEN an equivalent feature SHALL be available in the web frontend
2. WHEN a feature is available in the web frontend THEN an equivalent feature SHALL be available in the MCP server
3. IF a new feature is added to one component THEN a plan SHALL exist for adding it to the other component

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clear development workflow for implementing features across both interfaces, so that I can efficiently add new capabilities to the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new feature is planned THEN the development process SHALL specify whether it affects one or both components
2. WHEN implementing a feature that affects both components THEN the development workflow SHALL provide guidance on the order of implementation
3. IF a feature requires changes to shared components THEN the workflow SHALL ensure backward compatibility

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want to establish clear boundaries between the frontend interfaces and backend services, so that the system remains modular and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN designing the system architecture THEN clear interfaces SHALL be defined between frontend components and backend services
2. WHEN backend services are modified THEN the impact on frontend components SHALL be minimized through stable APIs
3. IF a new backend service is added THEN it SHALL be accessible to both frontend components through a consistent interface
