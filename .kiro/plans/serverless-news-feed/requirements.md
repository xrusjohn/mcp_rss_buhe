# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will transform the existing RSS news feed application into a serverless backend architecture with GraphQL API and real-time subscription capabilities. The current system uses a traditional server-based approach with MySQL database and TypeORM for data persistence. The new serverless architecture will provide better scalability, reduced operational costs, improved performance by leveraging cloud-native services, and enable real-time updates to clients through GraphQL subscriptions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to migrate the existing RSS feed backend to a serverless architecture, so that it can scale automatically and reduce operational overhead.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the serverless functions are deployed THEN the system SHALL provide the same functionality as the current backend
2. WHEN a new RSS feed is added THEN the system SHALL automatically update the database without manual intervention
3. WHEN the system fetches RSS feeds THEN it SHALL use scheduled serverless functions instead of cron jobs
4. WHEN the system processes RSS feeds THEN it SHALL handle errors gracefully without crashing the entire service
5. WHEN the system fetches articles THEN it SHALL only store articles published on or after the current date
6. WHEN the system processes articles THEN it SHALL detect and prevent duplicate articles from being stored

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access my news feed content through a serverless API, so that I can get faster response times and higher availability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests news feed content THEN the system SHALL return results within 500ms
2. WHEN multiple users access the API simultaneously THEN the system SHALL scale automatically to handle the load
3. WHEN a user filters content by status or source THEN the system SHALL return only the matching articles
4. WHEN a user requests a specific number of articles THEN the system SHALL limit the response accordingly
5. WHEN a user queries articles by date range THEN the system SHALL return articles published within that range
6. WHEN a user requests articles from the last N days THEN the system SHALL return only articles published within that relative time period

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use cloud-native database services, so that I don't have to manage database infrastructure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system stores article data THEN it SHALL use a managed database service
2. WHEN the database needs to scale THEN it SHALL do so automatically without manual intervention
3. WHEN database operations are performed THEN the system SHALL use appropriate connection pooling and optimization
4. WHEN the system starts up THEN it SHALL automatically create necessary database tables if they don't exist
5. WHEN articles are stored THEN the system SHALL preserve all metadata including source feed, title, abstract, publish date, and author

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to monitor the serverless functions, so that I can ensure the system is operating correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a serverless function executes THEN the system SHALL log appropriate information for debugging
2. WHEN a serverless function encounters an error THEN the system SHALL capture and report the error details
3. WHEN the system performance degrades THEN administrators SHALL receive alerts
4. WHEN the system is deployed THEN it SHALL include appropriate metrics for monitoring

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement a GraphQL API with subscription support, so that client applications can receive real-time updates when new content is available.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client subscribes to content updates THEN the system SHALL push notifications when new articles are available
2. WHEN a client queries the GraphQL API THEN the system SHALL return only the requested fields
3. WHEN a new article is added to the database THEN the system SHALL trigger notifications to subscribed clients
4. WHEN the GraphQL schema is updated THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility
5. WHEN a client performs mutations THEN the system SHALL validate input data before processing

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement a notification system, so that users can receive alerts about new content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new article is published THEN the system SHALL trigger an SNS notification
2. WHEN a user subscribes to notifications THEN the system SHALL register their endpoint with SNS
3. WHEN notifications are sent THEN the system SHALL include relevant article metadata
4. WHEN a notification fails to deliver THEN the system SHALL log the failure and retry according to SNS best practices
5. WHEN a user unsubscribes THEN the system SHALL immediately stop sending notifications to that endpoint
